It engages the collective wisdom of all stakeholders in deciding how to bring change about, and rapidly builds trust between different areas and different levels in the organization. If you want to reduce blame, backbiting, and mistrust in your team, and you want better communication between departments and more staff engagement, being able to use positive change methods is vital.If you are involved in change management or organizational development and you want to implement a more flexible, appreciative and strengths-based culture within your team or organization, you need to know about the Appreciative Inquiry method for rapid, participative change.The emphasis of this engaging, hands-on course is very much on practical, hands-on learning. By the end of this course, participants will be able to start using positive change methods for organizational change, teambuilding and individual coaching and development.Learning Outcomes:Understand and be able to apply the principles of Appreciative InquiryBe able to structure a team coaching session to improve engagement, communication, and effectivenessKnow how to quickly build trust to get diverse groups talking freely to each otherHave a format for engaging stakeholders in collaborating on creating a shared visionKnow how to unleash the creativity of team members to generate new ideasBe able to take a team from vision to action plan in less than two hours, with an engaging, participative method that involves the whole teamCourse Content:Pre-study: Understanding the origins and principles of Appreciative InquiryIntro to Appreciative InquiryThe neuroscience of Appreciative InquiryPrinciples of Appreciative InquiryThe 5-D format (Definition, Discover, Dream, Design, and Delivery/ Destiny).Ch 1: The Definition StageCh 2: The Discovery StageCh 3: The Dream StageCh 4: The Design StageCh 5: The Delivery Stage, when to use Appreciative Inquiry, Implementation Formats",Language:English
